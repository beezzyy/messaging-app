# BubbleðŸ«§

Bubble is a messaging app that is built using react-native technology. It is essentially a Signal-clone, which means that it offers a secure and private platform for communication. Bubble is designed to provide its users with an excellent mobile app experience while allowing them to become familiar with Firebase, a cloud-based database system, that can be used for authentication, database management, and hosting. The app offers a range of features to its users, including end-to-end encryption, voice messages, group chat, and more. Overall, Bubble is a great option for anyone looking for a reliable messaging app that prioritizes security and privacy.

Bubble was developed as a means for the creator (@beezzyy) to gain experience building mobile apps and to showcase their development skills.
